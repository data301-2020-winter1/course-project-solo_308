## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I have been playing since I was a kid. My earliest memory is me playing Mario and Dave. Ever since then, I have been a huge gamer. Therefore, when I was searching for a dataset on Kaggle, I came across a dataset collected by Gregory Smith. In this dataset, he had a game name, published year, platform and sale values in different continents. As I saw that dataset, I actually found games which I have played and I could relate to it. Therefore, I decided to work on this dataset because I can answer many questions such as why a particular game did good (in terms of sales) in Japan but in North America?

Till now, I have not come up with a question yet because there are many choices. I think I can make a user-facing dashboard with this dataset. If I have to give a simple example here, I would make a dashboard of how a particular game sale records across different platforms. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was generated by a scrape from vgchartz.com. It was collected and posted on Kaggle by GregorySmith. This dataset contains information regarding video game which have sold copies over 100,000 and it is not restricted to only one platform. The dataset has data of games till 2016 and the last update was in 2016. The purpose of the dataset is to provide a sale record of games with over 100,000 copies sold in North America, Europe, Japan, and Globally across different platforms (PS4, Xbox, PC, ...). This dataset also provides the published year and the genre. You can answer an interesting question with this dataset such as which publisher is most diverse in terms of genre? For example, EA (Electronic Arts) has gamed from 11 different genres and also figure out which genre they were most successful in?


The data is collected by https://www.vgchartz.com/. They collect data regarding the video game sales in major cities and continents. This website also offers sales record of different games console as well.
