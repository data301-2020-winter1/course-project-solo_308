=======
I have been playing since I was a kid. My earliest memory is me playing Mario and Dave. Ever since then, I have been a huge gamer. Therefore, when I was searching for a dataset on Kaggle, I came across a dataset collected by Gregory Smith. In this dataset, he had a game name, published year, platform and sale values in different continents. As I saw that dataset, I actually found games which I have played and I could relate to it. Therefore, I decided to work on this dataset because I can answer many questions such as why a particular game did good (in terms of sales) in Japan but in North America?

Till now, I have not come up with a question yet because there are many choices. I think I can make a user-facing dashboard with this dataset. If I have to give a simple example here, I would make a dashboard of how a particular game sale records across different platforms.
